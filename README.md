- Hi my name is AJ. I recently got into the world of IT and coding around the end of 2022.
- Things that interest me are learning how to become a jack of all trades related to IT but specialize in Networking & Security
- Currently I am going to school to finish my Bachelors in CyberOperations & Information Technology
- Pursing my masters in CyberDefense
- Recently I have been able to open my mind to a more abstract way of thinking regarding how to code in python
- Hobbies are working out, gaming, studying and spending time with my friends & family
